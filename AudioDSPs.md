## Audio DSPs

- [The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK)](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/) - a set of open source audio signal processing and algorithmic synthesis classes written in the C++ programming language.<br>
- [MadronaLib](https://github.com/madronalabs/madronalib) - provides one clear path to writing maintainable audio code without sacrificing performance.<br>
- [AudioGridder](https://github.com/apohl79/audiogridder) - a plugin host, that allows you to offload the DSP processing of audio plugins to remote computers running macOS or Windows.<br>
- [DSP filters in C++](https://github.com/dimtass/DSP-Cpp-filters) - This repo contains some DSP biquad filters used in audio.<br>
- [lavadsp](https://github.com/natanbc/lavadsp) - A bunch of lavaplayer audio filters implemented with native code<br>
